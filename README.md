This zip file has 3 folders and is used to run the interface that would enable the user to make queries using either the solr syntax or search for specific words or filter the reviews according to their rating.
In order to run this interface, please follow the steps mentioned below.
Run solr on your local host and create a core jcg.
Create a schema for the xml file all_amazon_reviews.xml.xml
Index the file all_amazon_reviews.xml.xml inside the core jcg
Now click on the query section.
Run Apache server on your local host and run search.php.
Search.php will display all the reviews for the book "Harry Potter and the cursed child" that are available on amazon.
Now run modified_homepage.html.
This will produce the interfae that would enable you to search.
Here you can search according to the preference.
Once the results are displayed you can choose to make another search by going back to the search interface.
