# IR-Project

This project has 3 files. The .xml file is the xml version of the reviews that can be used to create a new core in solr and index it. Please name the new core as final in order for the other two files to work. This version of xml is modified according to the requirements of solr so any other version that might which is a direct conversion of .csv to .xml might not work. Please use this version only.

The attempt .php file is used to display the reviews in a pretty format. Run the solr and execute the query in the solr. Then run the attempt.php to find the results in an organized manner. 

Just realized that it doesn't display anything from the second page onwards, which might also be something to do with the code.

Search engine.php is used to create the search engine. Try running it after you run the solr. The last time I checked it says got error in line 9.
